# recipe-generator
The Recipe Generator Project is an application that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques to generate unique and creative recipes. This project aims to provide users with an automated and intelligent solution for creating new and interesting dishes.

## Technologies Used

The Recipe Generation Project is built using the following technologies:

**Streamlit:** The powerful language model that forms the foundation of the recipe generation system, providing natural language processing capabilities.

**Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the project, including data processing, model integration, and the user interface.

**Streamlit:** A Python library for building interactive web applications. Streamlit is used to create a user-friendly interface for the application, allowing users to input their preferences, view generated recipes, and interact with the system.

**HTML/CSS:** The standard web development technologies used to design and style the user interface.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, users can access the application through a web browser. The user interface provides a form where users can input their preferences and ingredients. After submitting the form, the system generates a recipe tailored to the provided inputs, which users can then view, save, or print.

To start the application, run the following command:
```python
streamlit run app.py
```
